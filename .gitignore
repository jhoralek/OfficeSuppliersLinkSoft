This is awesome. Thanksyou. You can also get a good gitignore file by using the Team Explorer view in Visual Studio. Go to the repo, go to settings, and if you do not have a .gitignore already, you can create one which looks similar to this gist.

Would add .vs/ in there too (for ignoring Visual Studio config/temp dirs)
